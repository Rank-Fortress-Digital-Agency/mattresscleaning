            <p>Since you are going to spend approximately one-third of your life in bed, it is important to benefit from the perks of having a quality mattress that can provide you with the support you are looking for. A good mattress will make or break your sleep at night and improve or trigger additional back pain problems. If you are tired of tossing and turning restlessly at night because of a bad mattress, maybe it’s time to get rid of it. If you are looking for the answer to the question “What is the average lifespan of a mattress?”, you’ve reached the right page.</p>

            <p>These next few lines will talk about the average lifespan of mattresses, tell you how long you can use your mattress, and help you decide whether it is time to have your mattress replaced.</p><br>
            <h2>For How Long Can I Use My Mattress?</h2>
            <p>The majority of mattresses will normally last an average of seven to ten years. With so many different models and types of mattresses available on the market, there may be slight differences from mattress to mattress. Also, there are several factors that will also influence the lifespan of any given mattress. They refer to the build quality of your mattress, the materials it is made from, its weight, or the type of sleeper you are. These could all more or less affect the longevity of your mattress.</p>
            <p>While there is no “expiration date” printed on a mattress, you will need to decide whether it is time to invest in a new bed or not. If you have started to notice that you are not enjoying the same level of comfort or support from your mattress, the quality of your sleep is also most likely suffering. This is why purchasing a new mattress should become your number-one priority. Here is what you should pay attention to:</p>

            <h2>The Type of Mattress</h2>
            <p>A mattress made of latex will last the longest, up to 8.5 to 10 years on average, next to models made from polyfoams or memory foams of high density. If you own a mattress made from foam of a lower density or a hybrid mattress, expect it to wear out sooner. Standard innerspring mattresses usually have the shortest lifespan, and you will have to replace them somewhere around five to six and a half years.</p><br>
            <h2>The Initial Quality of the Mattress</h2>
            <p>If your mattress is a top-quality one with a higher price tag, it is prone to last longer compared to a cheaper, entry-level model. Expensive mattresses are usually better built and will have a longer lifespan. However, a high price will not automatically guarantee you will buy a superior product.</p><br>
            <h2>Your Mattress Care Routine</h2>
            <p>The better you will care for your mattress, the longer you can expect it to last. The right mattress care protocol should include a proper deep routine cleaning, the use of protective covers, carefully following all manufacturer instructions and recommendations regarding care, cleaning, and spot removal, and the right flipping or rotating times.</p><br>
            <h2>When to Replace My Mattress?</h2>
            <p>If you are still not sure if it is time to replace your mattress, figure out if the quality of your sleep is suffering lately because of your mattress. If you find yourself getting better rest when sleeping at a hotel or when visiting your friends or family, or if you oftentimes wake up feeling aches and pains all over your body, it is probably time to replace your mattress. Also, if you have noticed your allergies or any new asthma symptoms have gotten worse while asleep, you should also consider donating or recycling your old mattress and investing in a new one. If it has been more than seven years since you bought a new mattress, it may just be time to buy a new one.</p>
            <p>If you can honestly say you are still enjoying a peaceful and comfortable sleep at night and you are pleased with your mattress, you may be able to use it for a few more years. Remember to check the warranty and see if any issues you might be having with your mattress could be covered under it.</p>
